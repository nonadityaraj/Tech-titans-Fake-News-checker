## 🧩 Problem Statement

In college campuses, students rely on multiple disconnected platforms such as WhatsApp groups, college portals, emails, and physical notice boards for academic and campus-related information. This fragmented system causes information overload, missed updates, and inefficient communication.

Important announcements, academic discussions, and schedules often get buried under irrelevant messages, making them difficult to track. Moreover, the absence of a centralized system limits collaboration, peer learning, doubt resolution, and structured resource sharing. Existing tools are either outdated or academically restrictive, failing to support real-time interaction and community engagement.
